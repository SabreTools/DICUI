# DICUI

DiscImageCreator UI in C#

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3ldav3v0c373jeqa?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mnadareski/dicui/build/artifacts)

This is a community project, so if you have some time and knowledge to give, we'll be glad to add you to the contributor of this project :)

We are using DiscImageCreator (DIC), created by Sarami, and we would like to thanks him for his great software. The latest release of DIC can be found on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/saramibreak/DiscImageCreator)

This project relies on two open-source code ports to help perform copy protection scanning: [BurnOutSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/BurnOutSharp) and [UnshieldSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/UnshieldSharp)

## System Requirements

Even though this is written in C#, this program can only be used on Windows systems due to the base program, DiscImageCreator, being Windows-only. There is some preliminary support for Linux underway, and we will try to integrate with that when the time comes.

- Windows 7 (newest version of Windows recommended)
- .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Framework 4.7.2, or .NET Core 3.0 Runtimes
- 128 MB of free RAM
- As much hard drive space as amount of discs you will be dumping (20+ GB recommended)

Ensure that your operating system is as up-to-date as possible, since some features may rely on those updates.
